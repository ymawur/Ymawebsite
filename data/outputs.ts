      "Food in the Hood is a podcast hosted by Amanda Sia and Yizhou (Ben) Ma that explores food beyond recipes and trends. Each episode brings together perspectives from food science, industry, research, and lived experience to discuss complex topics in an accessible, conversational format.\n\nAcross episodes, we examine food as science, technology, culture, and personal experience. Topics include food chemistry, processing, nutrition, ingredient innovation, sustainability, and the social and historical context behind everyday food choices. We also reflect on education, careers, and current events in the food world to connect technical ideas with real-life practice.\n\nThe podcast is designed for listeners who are curious about how food systems work in practice and how scientific knowledge translates into products, policies, and daily decisions.",

      "A perspective on how modern AI models address food at molecular, product, and material scales, and where major gaps remain.",
    description:
      "This project provides a structured perspective on how artificial intelligence is currently transforming food science and where major conceptual gaps remain. It examines three major abstraction levels: molecules, products, and materials.\n\nAt the molecular level, large AI models such as protein language models and graph neural networks enable prediction of structure, stability, and functionality directly from chemical or sequence representations. These approaches support rational exploration of peptide functions, flavor compounds, and molecular taste mechanisms. At the product level, vision and vision-language models analyze food images and videos to estimate nutrients, portion size, and calories, while also enabling preference modeling, personalization, and quality assessment.\n\nIn contrast, food as materials (pastes, gels, emulsions, and complex multiphase systems) remains underrepresented in modern AI pipelines. These systems are governed by multiscale physics, are highly process-dependent, and lack standardized representations and datasets. This work highlights the need for new representations and hybrid modeling strategies that connect molecules to products through structure and processing.",

    description:
      "Fiberlyzer is an open-source, image-based method for automated, quantitative, and standardized assessment of visual fibrousness in plant-based meat analogues. While mechanical texture analysis provides important insights into material properties, visual fibrous structures are often evaluated subjectively and rely heavily on expert judgment. Fiberlyzer addresses this gap by providing an objective computer vision pipeline for characterizing fibrous appearance directly from 2D images.\n\nThe method segments fibrous regions from images and extracts fiber shape features that describe structural organization, including fiber length, width, area, and branching behavior. A key metric, the fiber score (length-to-width ratio), shows strong correlation with expert panel evaluations, particularly when comparing formulations. In addition to supporting formulation optimization, Fiberlyzer enables structural similarity analysis between different samples and reference materials, such as cooked chicken breast.\n\nWith a simple imaging setup and user-friendly interface, Fiberlyzer is designed for integration into formulation development, quality control, and production workflows. By reducing dependence on expert visual inspection, the method offers a rapid, low-cost, and reproducible approach to evaluating visual fibrousness in meat analogues.",

      "Integrating physical laws with neural networks to improve prediction, generalization, and data efficiency in food kinetics.",
    description:
      "This project explores the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling food quality kinetics during processing and storage. Traditional kinetic modeling relies on predefined equations, while purely data-driven models often struggle with extrapolation. PINNs combine both approaches by embedding known physical and kinetic relationships directly into neural network training.\n\nUsing case studies in seed drying, bread baking, and kiwi softening, the study demonstrates that PINN models outperform empirical models in both interpolation and extrapolation tasks and achieve comparable performance to physics-based models when sufficient data are available. PINNs also support transfer learning, enabling efficient adaptation to new datasets with minimal retraining.\n\nThe work highlights both strengths and limitations. PINNs show strong generalization and data efficiency, but challenges remain when handling discontinuities associated with multistage processing or abrupt transitions. Overall, the results position PINNs as a promising modeling framework for modern food kinetics, especially when data are limited but physical knowledge is available.",
